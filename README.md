# work-day-planner
A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day.
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The app will display standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Each time slot should represent one hour.


Clicking on the save button will store the time and user input in localStorage.

Near the top of the calendar, the application will display the current day. Additionally, each hour will be color coded to reflect whether the time slot is in the past, present, or future. This will also change depending on the time of day.
